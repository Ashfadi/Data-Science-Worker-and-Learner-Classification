When you work on this assignment, you should make a copy of this notebook in Google Colab. This can be done using the option `File > Save a copy in Drive` in Google Colab. \n","\n","2. You should fill in your answer for each task inside the code block right below the task. \n","\n","3. You should only insert your code into the designated code blocks, as mentioned above. Other than that, you shouldn't change anything else in the notebook, unless otherwise instructed.\n","\n","4.  For each code block, you are free to use multiple lines of code. Tasks 1-4 only need one line (or a few) each. Tasks 5 and 6 will need longer codes.\n","\n","5.   Even if you can only partially solve a task, you should include your code in the code block, which allows us to consider partial credit. \n","\n","6.   However, your code should not raise errors.

You can chose which feature columns to include in building the model. You can tune your model by using any combination of parameter values. You can even implement your own method. \n","\n","Make sure to follow the good practice we learned about model selection and model evaluation. For model evaluation: \n","\n","1.   Partition the dataset into training set and test set. The test set shouldn't be used in any way during training your model. \n","2.   Use cross-validation in order to get more robust evaluation results. \n","3.   After evaluation, you can train your model again on the whole dataset. Then the trained model can be made available to classify unseen instances in the future. Of course, in this assignment, we don't really have unseen instances to be applied. Maybe you can plug in your own information to see how the model predicts, just for fun. \n","\n","For model selection: \n","\n","1.   Model selection is the step for choosing the optimal model among multiple different types of models (e.g., a decision tree vs. a kNN classifier), or for tuning the hyperparameters (e.g., the maximum depth in a decision tree) in order to get the optimal model within the same family of models. \n","\n","2.  In model selection, you further partition the training set (from model evaluation) into train set and validation set.  (Here we call it 'train set', to make it clear it is a subset of the 'training set'.)\n","\n","3.  Different models are trained using the train test and their performance on the validation set is used to select the best model and/or best hyperparameters. \n","\n","4. Model section itself can also use cross-validation. \n","\n","Note that it is non-trivial to implement model selection on your own. Fortunately, `scikit-learn` provides support for this too. **In this assignment, you are required to perform model evaluatuon. You are not required to perform model selection.** Instead, in this assignment, you can compare and select models based on their perforance on the test set.
